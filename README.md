# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to understand and summarize fare data between number of drivers and between the different city types. 

## Results

Across the three city types, urban cities had the highest fare rates, followed by suburban and lastly rural. This is the case across the span of January to April. All three city types see peaks in fares towards the end of February. 

From the summary table of ride data across the three city types. Urban cities had the highest number of total rides, drivers, and fares. Followed by suburban and lastly rural cities. However rural cities had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, followed by subruban and lastly urban cities. 

## Summary

Our recommendations would be to increase the number of drivers in subruban and rural cities to help reduce average fare costs. We would also recommend researching what factors influence a peak in rides towards the end of February to better understand our customers.
